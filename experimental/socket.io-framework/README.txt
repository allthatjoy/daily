To test samples within this directory:
Pull the repository:
git clone https://github.com/timhaag/daily

Navigate to the mongoose folder where this file is also in.

Run:
npm install

Run the sample e. g.:
node server.js

It may be a little annoying to restart you server every time you change a file.
There's a nice npm package called "nodemon" which restarts you server every
time you've changed anything.

Install is using:
npm install nodemon -g
