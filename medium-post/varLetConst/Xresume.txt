I hope there is one big question after you've learned the
differences of var, let and const.

Question:
Why and when should I use "var" in the future?

Answer:
You shouldn't because there isn't a reason anymore in ECMAScript6 to use "var".
As a programmer you always should use variables in the smallest possible scope,
also called mutable state minimization, to prevent unexpected and
even strange behaviour as in example 2 of "var":

(function(){
  i = 1;
})();
console.log('i', i);

If you're not aware of behaviour like that you can fall in trap doors leading
to unnecessary debugging time even if your code syntax isn't wrong at all!
